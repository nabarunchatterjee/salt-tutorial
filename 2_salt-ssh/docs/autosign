If the autosign_file is specified incoming keys specified in the autosign_file
will be automatically accepted. Matches will be searched for first by string
comparison, then by globbing, then by full-string regex matching. This should
still be considered a less than secure option, due to the fact that trust is
based on just the requesting minion id.

Master Config option
autosign_file: /etc/salt/autosign.conf

Using Custom state
sudo salt-ssh -i 'master' state.sls autosign pillar="{'minion_list' : ['master', 'minion1', 'minion2', 'minion3']}"
